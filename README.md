# Get Started

Your own branch is already created, named `member/<your-name>`. 

Please fork **this** repo and for each week's assignment, create a branch `<week-number>/<topic-name>`. For example, for week 2, your branch will be called `week2/breadth-first-search`.

You will mainly work off the `<week-number>/<topic-name>` branch in your **forked** repo.

When you finish the assignment, open up a pull request to merge it to the `member/<your-name>` branch in **this** primary repo.

Each pull request requires at least 2 approvals.

Topics are listed as below:

* Week 1: binary-search
* Week 2: breadth-first-search
* Week 3: depth-first-search 
* Week 4: back-tracking 
* Week 5: divide-and-conquer 
* Week 6: dynamic-programming 
* Week 7: topological-sort 
* Week 8: bit-manipulation
